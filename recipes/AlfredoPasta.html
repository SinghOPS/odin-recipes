    <h2>
      Easy Pasta Alfredo : Creamy, comforting, absolutely delicious, and super
      easy. This is the best and most simple recipe for Alfredo sauce that you
      will find!
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is one of my absolute favorite sauces to make. Why? Well its
      incredibly easy, it is so versatile, and the three main ingredients are
      butter, cream, and cheese. How can you go wrong with that?! While I used
      this sauce over pasta, you can make pizzas and flatbreads with it, or even
      use it as a dip. Thank you, Italy, for blessing the culinary world once
      again.
